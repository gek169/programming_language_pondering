Implementing everything to get function bodies parsing is hard. I'm going to do it in an order that allows me to test things.

Going to add a special thing that allows me to test expression parsing in data_test.


int myint;
int myint2;
float myfloat;

//expr_test will obviously be removed...
expr_test myint = myint2 + cast(int)myfloat--;


1. Parse the sizeof operation.

sizeof -> open parentheses -> parse_type() -> close parentheses

2. Parse the identifier.

	identifier (not function)

	Matches an identifier that is not defined already as being a function.

	consequently it is illegal to use an identifier name which is also the name of a function.

3. Parse the integer and float literals.

4.
