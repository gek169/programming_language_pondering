## What is Seabass designed for?

systems implementation. It is purpose-built for writing operating systems,
kernels, bootloaders, compilers, game engines, and any situation under which manual memory management
and obvious control flow are required.

This means, for instance:

* Seabass does not have constructors or destructors.

* Seabass does not have `new` and `delete` or any similar functionality.

* Seabass does not have a standard template library, standard library, or any other set of
standard runtime functions, as such is not portable between platforms.
